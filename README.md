A multilayer perceptron (deep learning model) designed to predict the value of crop exports depending on multiple factors spread across multiple datasets.
Key features were identified using Random Forest, which measured collinearity. 

A custom implementation of MSE was written that ignores a sentinel value, that represents null values, in the dataset. This allowed the maximum number of features in the dataset and didn't penalise countries that hadn't collected as much data as others. 

This work was graded 77%. The mean grade for the class was 60.48%.
